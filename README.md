# ScreenWatcher
 FFXIV Login Script
 
 I wrote this script when FFXIV Endwalker launched. There was a major bug where, while you were in queue waiting to log in, you would get a connection error (error 2002) and have to re-queue. Since these queues were potentially hours-long, I wrote this script so that I would get a phone notification through Pushbullet if I got the error OR successfully logged in, by watching the pixels in the window. This way I could walk away from the screen and do whatever without being worried.
 
 The bug has since been fixed, but this was a useful and successful project at the time so I'm uploading it for posterity.
